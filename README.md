# Family Module Paywall
The aim of this project is to re-build [this](https://logmycare.co.uk/pricing/family/) page in ReactJS.

## Pre-requisites

### NodeJS
NodeJS is a JavaScript "runtime" that let's you run JavaScript outside of a browser.
We've developed out backend and API completely in Node, but it's also an essential tool for front-end developers.
To install it, go to [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and download the "Current" distribution.

To check that the installation worked, try opening up a terminal and typing `node`.
This should open up an interactive JavaScript session, just like running `python` on the terminal.

### Yarn
Yarn is a package manager for Node and JavaScript. It makes it super easy to download open-source packages, similar to `pip` in python.

Try running this command to install it: `curl -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash`
Otherwise, follow the installation instructions [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable)

### VS Code
Everyone has different code editors, but I'd recommend downloading [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) if you haven't already.

### Git
You'll also need to install a version control tool called [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).

### GitHub
Set up a [GitHub account](https://github.com/) and let me know what your username is. I'll add you as a contributor to the project, so you can push any changes you've made.


## Getting Started
Once you're all set up you can download the code in this repository and use yarn to install all the dependencies:
```
git clone https://github.com/adamhurst/lmc-family-paywall.git
cd lmc-family-paywall
yarn install
yarn start
```

You're all set to start developing! Open up the project in VS Code and any changes you make to the code in the `./src` folder will be reflected immediately in the browser window that just appeared.

## Important Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
